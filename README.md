Design And Development of a Graduate Skill Sets.

University students who want to do well in school give most of their attention to things like their coursework, research, and tests. Unfortunately, many students don't put enough emphasis on developing the employability skills that will help them get the jobs of their dreams after graduation. Disconcertingly many college grads wind up in jobs unrelated to their majors or remain unemployed for lengthy stretches of time (Claydon et al., 2021; Taylor & Hooley, 2014). The present job market, in which employers want a wider range of abilities beyond academic knowledge, only serves to exacerbate this gap between aspirations and realities (Bass &Eynon; Iqbal et al. 2022).
